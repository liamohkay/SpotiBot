  - ^^ make this context
  - Add private routes + redirect on no user auth to login + link to spotify pages
  - Refactor oauth

  - database
    - on signup -> create new doc w/ user
    - on login -> retrieve user doc from firestore & load database (probably should be context)
    - indexed key should be uid from user Auth
    - rules needs to be set so user can read/write to their specific doc


  - Add playlist check verification + delete if no longer in spotify playlists
  - Auth context spotify access token as well
  - Set up as env variables for deployment
  - I mean you probably wanna stop scraping access token from url and actually res return it from oauth

- Add infinite scroll to subredddit list
- Add delete playlist option ^^

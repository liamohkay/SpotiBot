# SpotiBot
SpotiBot is a web application that leverages the constant stream of new music posted to Reddit and combines it with the listening convenience of Spotify.

SpotiBot aggregates top music posts from user-inputted subreddits, searches for the corresponding songs on Spotify, and then adds the songs to a single Spotify playlist. SpotiBot alleviates the painstaking process of visiting a sundry of different subreddits and clicking through multiple external links just to listen to a song.
